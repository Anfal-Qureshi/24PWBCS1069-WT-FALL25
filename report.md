# Lab 01 Reflection

In this lab, I learned how to set up Git and GitHub for version control.  
I practiced creating and editing files, committing changes, and pushing them to a remote repository.  
I also learned how to use branches for experimental changes and how to merge them back into the main branch.  
This helped me understand the workflow of real-world projects and improved my confidence in using Git commands.
